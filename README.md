Free gestor for stores

Platypus will always be free and open source. Any error, issue or suggestion about it, please write an email to platypus.gestion@gmail.com

Platypus is a free comprehensive management system, developed with the sole aim of helping the community of small entrepreneurs. The ones for which every penny counts, and make a big investment in a system for your business is not an option.

My goal is to contribute a little to the order, productivity and control of the business. Thus avoiding the so well known notebook with the annotations of each sale of the day, payments to suppliers and their contact details.
